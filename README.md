üöÄ DevOps Engineer with 7+ years of expertise in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and automation, now leveraging newly acquired full-stack Java development skills. I'm passionate about building robust software solutions, blending deep operational knowledge with dynamic web application development across Azure and AWS.

üîß My career spans automating build, test, and deployment processes using Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, to developing Infrastructure as Code with Terraform and ARM templates. I've recently completed intensive training in full-stack Java development, mastering Spring Boot for backend services and React for engaging frontends. I'm now equipped to deliver end-to-end solutions, as demonstrated by my full-stack project management application with JWT authentication, real-time notifications via WebSocket, and a robust Spring Boot backend. My cloud experience includes working with both Azure and AWS platforms.

üí° I thrive in Agile environments, driving continuous improvement and solving complex problems. My experience includes leading Kubernetes adoption with liveness probes and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, automating patch management with Ansible, and resolving critical production incidents. I'm adept at using tools like GitHub, Docker, Prometheus, and Grafana to ensure system reliability and performance. I have created a Java Microservice CI/CD Pipeline on Azure DevOps, featuring gated approvals, and infrastructure provisioning using Bicep templates.

üéì Having completed the Full Stack Development Program at Integrify Academy, I'm ready to build scalable and efficient applications. I hold certifications as a Microsoft DevOps Engineer Expert, Azure Administrator Associate, and Azure Developer Associate, demonstrating my commitment to cloud technologies.

ü§ù Let's connect! I'm eager to network, share insights, and explore opportunities in DevOps and full-stack development. Feel free to reach out to discuss technology, collaboration, or potential projects!
